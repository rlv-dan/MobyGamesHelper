# MobyGames Credits Helper

A utility I created in order to make entering credits into [MobyGames](www.mobygames.com) faster and more automated. The technique used is very simple: Load credits as text with a certain format, then let the utility automatically paste it into the browser. Since it was a long time ago I last used it, MobyGames may have changed their page layouts and make this utility outdated, I don't know right now.
